# Weight Normalisation
The weight_norm.py file can be found within the PyTorch v0.4.1 library (/pytorch/torch/nn/utils/weight_norm.py).

## Accelerators
In total, there are three accelerators designed which aim to accelerate the different dimensions of the input. Comments can be used to carefully use the three accelerators.
