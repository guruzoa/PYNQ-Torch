# PYNQ-Torch
PYNQ-Torch: a framework to develop PyTorch accelerators on the PYNQ platform

# Brief Desciption
The following repository provides information on setting up the environment as well as examples for using the proposed framework. It is organised as follows:
  - The **PyTorch Installation** folder provides steps on how to install PyTorch v1.2.0 on the PYNQ OS v2.4. It also provides an example on how to use the tools effectively to embed an accelerator within an application, which includes Vivado project files.
  - The **SampleRNN** folder showcases the accelerators being used within a state-of-the-art RNN application. Again, includes Vivado project files.
